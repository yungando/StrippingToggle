# StrippingToggle

## Features

Provides a toggle for axe stripping and path creation.

Toggle using 'B' by default. Small Axe and Shovel icons appear above crosshair when active.

### Disclaimer

Obviously not the first to make a "no log stripping" mod, but wasn't happy with how intrusive some of the indicators
were in other implementations.

HUD Element heavily inspired by [MT Random Block Placement](https://modrinth.com/mod/random-block-placement) by
MEGATREX4.
